  - Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks the
    pancreas where insulin is made.
  - You need insulin to help open up the cells to let your glucose molecules in the
    cells to convert to energy.
  - Your blood sugar is measured by how much sugar is in your bloodstream.  An average
    blood sugar is between 70-140 mg/dL.
  - "If your blood sugar is too low that means you used too much insulin to open
    up the cells. If your blood sugar is too high that means you need more insulin
    to open up the cells to let the little GLUKI\u2019s in."
