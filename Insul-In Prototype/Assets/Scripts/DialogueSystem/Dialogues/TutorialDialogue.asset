  - Hello! I am GLUKI! A glucose molecule in your body.
  - You just ate a yummy snack that contains lots of GLUKI's!
  - But now, all your GLUKI's are floating in your bloodstream!
  - We need your help to get the GLUKI's from the bloodstream into your cells!
  - Insulin is like a key that allows the GLUKI's to enter. You will aim the Insulin
    to open up the cells!
  - The more GLUKI's that enter the cell, the lower your blood sugar level will go,
    since the GLUKI's convert to energy.
  - These yellow balls are your Insulin injections. To inject, tap on the yellow
    insulin ball to launch it into the cell!
  - The white rectangle is a paddle! Insulin launches from and bounces off of this.
  - The left and right squares on the side are for moving the cell. When you tap
    on one of them, the entire cell and everything inside of it will move in that
    direction!
  - Your goal is to get as many GLUKI's into the cell to have a happy blood sugar
    level!
  - You have one minute to complete this game challenge to meet your happy goal!
  - The happy level of between 80 to 140 is shown on the slider here.
  - Now, let's try it out. Good luck!
