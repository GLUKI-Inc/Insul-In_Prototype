  sentences:
  - Hello! I am GLUKI! A glucose molecule in your body.
  - You just ate yummy food cooked by your parent.
  - But now you have floating GLUKIs.
  - 'We need your help to shoot insulin so we can go home: your cell!'
  - This is your Blood Sugar Level. As the game progresses, this will go up.
  - Your goal is to get the GLUKI's inside of the cell and have the Blood Sugar Level
    decrease to the desired amount.
  - The desired amount is shown by the slider here. Try to get between 80 and 140!
  - The timer shows you how long you have to get your Blood Sugar Level to the desired
    amount.
  - You are telling the cell you are opening up by giving it insulin.
  - "The cell wall will open up to allow all of the happy GLUKI\u2019s in."
